## About

The objective of the project is to provide an application that allows the user to calculate possible travel itineraries between accessible Amazonian cities via boat trips, a commonly used mode of transportation in some cities due to the presence of numerous rivers in the region. The application also provides access to materials and articles indicating tourist attractions in the cities to be visited in the generated itinerary.

For the calculations of the shortest duration or the least total price routes, the [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) was employed as a practical application of the content covered in the Graphs 2 module of the Algorithms Design course in the Software Engineering program at the University of Bras√≠lia.

The map, as well as the route visualization, was created using the [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) and [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) tools.

Route, price, and duration information for boat trips were obtained from the [Navegam E-commerce](https://navegam.com.br/) and [iBarco](ibarco.com.br/) websites.

If you would like to contribute information regarding routes, prices, and duration of boat trips between cities in the Amazon, please contact the project contributors.
